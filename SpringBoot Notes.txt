Spring Boot Notes

********************************16th June
MVC Artitechture


Q.Why we are using the spring instead of java?
R.Features offer by spring like security,AOP,to build instead off java
  Reduce the bolier plate code
  Easy to testing the code
  Enables the loose coupling higher the cohesion 
  
  


-Spring is focused on busniess logic(the logic which makes the UI responsive)

******************************17th June
Spring initializer
--------------------------

DI :- Dependency injection
IOC:- 

Singleton : Single object for each class
Spring Cotainer:- The singleton object is save by sring that space is called Spring Cotainer.It is create and manage by Spring
Spring is reponsible for creating , managing and deleting of spring Container

Rule:-
	1. The object which is relted with database so no need to create singleton
	2. The object which required reference again thenn need to create singleton
	
***************************18th June
Create project through Spring initilizer and concept
----------------------------------------------------
To create project --> use spring initilizer in chrome

 - @component annotation:- create object of class in spring, so it will be use where we want object --of a class.So constructor is created

- @SpringBootApplication annotation :- It has three annotation inside it, @ComponentScan do check the @Component annotation in classes and create the object of that classes



- @Service :- It also create the object of a class so it can use the object in other classes.So constructor is created

- @Repository:-  It also create the object of a class so it can use the object in other classes.So constructor is created


- @Controller:- It also create the object of a class so it can use the object in other classes.So constructor is created  

- @RestController:- It also create the object of a class so it can use the object in other classes.So constructor is created

- @ComponentScan:- It also create the object of a class so it can use the object in other classes.So constructor is created


-----------Summar of above annotation-----------------------------------------------

- @Service, @Repository,@Controller,@RestController ,@ComponentScan & @Configuration  @SpringBootApplication are @Component from inside.Constructor is created

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To use this object have to use @AutoWired annotation with object name

Ex:- 	@AutoWired
		StudentController studentController;

-It create single object and use the same object to others Classes as well.This is called Singletone.


Q.  Why component have different annotiontion?
R. Different treatment and different reposnible for annotation 


****************************19th June
Handson Components
--------------------------
Task :- project Name sayhello (workspace - Spring Workspace)

*************************20th June
Q. What is Dependency injection?

@Primary :- it send the object of the class which having primary annotation. Mention above the class name. It use appropriate object

to check it syso(obj.account)


@Qualifier :- it send the object which mentioned.It is write where have write Autowire

ex:- @Autowired
     @Qualifier("savcc")    savcc = object name


@component("savcc")
public class SavingAccount 

Able to give the name to component 
to mention in Qualifier as mentioned "savcc"

-If mention Qualifier and Primary then, object send where Qualifer annotation is used

-If two to three class having Primary annotation then use the 
Qualifier then ignore the primary annotation in other classes.

- If injection use above property then it is property injection.

- To use only one object to other classes then have to use @Autowired 

- @Autowired is a property injection


**********************************23rd June

Dependency Injection
----------------------------

@Service("studentservice")

class StudentService{

}

@Repository("studentRepository")
class StudentRepository{

}

@RestController("studentController")
class StudentController{

}


Inversion of control(IOC) :-  Spring take a control to behaves property injection and other things. where the control of object instantiation and dependency management is inverted

Component Scan:- can the component to create the object
Autowired :- acheive the dependency injection


Spring having two things depndency injection and spring IOC 
---------------------------------------------------------------
Spring Boot contains:- 

Spring JPA
Spring AOP
Spring Web
Spring MVC
Spring Expection Hnadaling
Spring Security
Spring Testing
.....




Explore the Graph Query

Layers between Database and UI 
- UI --> RestController -->Service --> Repository --> Database  and vice versa 

********************************24th June
Hands On
--------------------
@Getmapping :- use to call in url
 ex:- @GetMapping("/getall") :- http://localhost:8080/getall

Use of Controller :- Take request , and give response 

@RestController:-To send data use restcontroller
@Controller:-to send html ,jsp page use Controller and use to send the controller
@ResponseBody:- reponse to 

****************************************25th June

- Rest controller also a controller
- To send data use the rest controller
- Don't send the view with rest controller

@Service
