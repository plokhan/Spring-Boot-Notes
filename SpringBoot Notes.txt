Spring initializer
--------------------------

DI :- Dependency injection
IOC:- 

Singleton : Single object for each class
Spring Cotainer:- The singleton object is save by sring that space is called Spring Cotainer.It is create and manage by Spring
Spring is reponsible for creating , managing and deleting of spring Container

Rule:-
	1. The object which is relted with database so no need to create singleton
	2. The object which required reference again thenn need to create singleton

Create project through Spring initilizer and concept
----------------------------------------------------
To create project --> use spring initilizer in chrome

 - @component annotation:- create object of class in spring, so it will be use where we want object --of a class.So constructor is created

- @SpringBootApplication annotation :- It has three annotation inside it, @ComponentScan do check the @Component annotation in classes and create the object of that classes



- @Service :- It also create the object of a class so it can use the object in other classes.So constructor is created

- @Repository:-  It also create the object of a class so it can use the object in other classes.So constructor is created


- @Controller:- It also create the object of a class so it can use the object in other classes.So constructor is created  

- @RestController:- It also create the object of a class so it can use the object in other classes.So constructor is created

- @ComponentScan:- It also create the object of a class so it can use the object in other classes.So constructor is created


-----------Summar of above annotation-----------------------------------------------

- @Service, @Repository,@Controller,@RestController ,@ComponentScan & @Configuration  @SpringBootApplication are @Component from inside.Constructor is created

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To use this object have to use @AutoWired annotation with object name

Ex:- 	@AutoWired
		StudentController studentController;

-It create single object and use the same object to others Classes as well.This is called Singletone.


Q.  Why component have different annotiontion?
R. Different treatment and different reposnible for annotation
